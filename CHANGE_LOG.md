# Welding Ltd. Continuum :: Change Log

* 2022-0212: 2.6.0.9 (Lisias) for 1.4.1 <= KSP <= 1.4.5
	+ Updated the thingy for the latest [KSPe](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSPAPIExtensions/releases).
		- Bug fixes
		- Better borderline use cases handling
		- Performance improvements 
	+ More sensible configuration handling:
		- Some configuration files are now **optional** on `PluginData`
		- Templates are now on `GameData` and copied to `PluginData` as needed
		- Some configurations can be overruled by changing them on a `PluginData` copy.
	+ Fixing some links on README
		- Thanks to [fwiffo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148084-fwiffo/) for the [report](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96670-14-253-2018-04-06-ubiozur-welding-ltd-continued/&do=findComment&comment=4072206). 
* 2020-0711: 2.6.0.8 (Lisias) for 1.4.1 <= KSP <= 1.4.5
	+ A less than ideal way of detecting ModuleManager was fixed.
		- Thanks for the [heads up](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/UbioWeldContinuum/issues/2), [Braste](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206105-braste/)!

	+ Another incredibly idiotic mistake was detected and fixed, this time from KSPe.
		- Thanks for the heads up, [The Space Man](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96670-14-253-2018-04-06-ubiozur-welding-ltd-continued/&do=findComment&comment=3798335)

		- Finally fully supporting KSP 1.4.5... =P
		- KSP >= 1.5 depends on implementing proper support for `ModulePartVariant`, something that will be tricky to say the least.
